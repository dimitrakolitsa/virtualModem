# Virtual Modem
Virtual modem in Java made to communicate with the Ithaki server and send echo packets, request images from cctv, request gps images and check if packets are received correctly or incorrectly using ARQ (ack-nack codes)


(The "Ithaki" server is currently down so this exact code won't work)
