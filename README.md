# Virtual Modem
Virtual modem in Java made to communicate with the Ithaki server and send echo packets, request images from cctv, request gps images with pins and check if packets are received correctly or incorrectly using ARQ (ack-nack codes).


This was a project for the subject "Computer Networks I" in the Electrical & Computer Engineering Department of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. 
(The "Ithaki" server is currently down so this exact code won't work)
